# OOP-Js-Game-Show-App

Browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter."

* Using the supplied HTML and CSS files as you can see in the first commit I added ALL the JavaScript code and I used OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

* I created two JavaScript classes with specific properties and methods. I created a Game class for managing the game, and a Phrase class to help with creating an array of Phrase objects.

* The code will cchoose a random phrase, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the gameboard.

* Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

* A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

* If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

* A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, the program will disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.
